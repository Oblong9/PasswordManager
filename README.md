# PasswordManager
A basic password manager.
This is my first full Python project. It uses random and os.path libraries. 
There is a very basic manual encryption I built in (mostly because Cryptography was not installing).
Features: Master Password, rudimentary encryption, add function, delete function, view function, and a password generator.
